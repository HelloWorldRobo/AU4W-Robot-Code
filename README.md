# AU4W-Robot-Code
This is my code (V-1.0) for my 4WD robot. The codename AU4W stands for: Arduino Uno 4 Wheel. 

Hello, 

This is V 1.0 for my Arduino 4WD project. 

1) The code would work for any 4WD that has the same amount of pins used and, the same things used in the project...
2) The code can be used by ANYONE and ANYONE can make any changes they want to make with the code
